    <h2>A Message from Warren E. Buffet</h2>
    <div>
      Dear Reader,
      <br>
      <br>
      You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However, I have two thoughts regarding your personal
      expenditures that can save you real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries of
      Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's.
      I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is
      not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in certain
      geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO does. I believe, however, that GEICO more
      frequently offers the low price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers. You can
      quickly find out whether you can save money by going to www.geico.com or by calling 800-555-2756.
      Fine jewelry, watches and giftware will almost certainly cost you less at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures
      for all publicly-owned jewelry companies and the contrast with Borsheim's is startling. Our one-store operation,
      with its huge volume, enables us to operate with costs that are fully 15-20 percentage points below those incurred
      by our competitors. We pass the benefits of this low-cost structure along to our customers.
      Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers who want a long-distance opportunity to
      inspect what it offers and decide which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge amount of business in
      this low-key way, which allows the shopper to conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer. Call Sean
      Moore or Karen Goracke at Borsheim's (800-642-4438) and save substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,
      <br>
      Warren E. Buffett
