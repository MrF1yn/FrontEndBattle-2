        <p><strong>Berkshire – Past, Present and Future</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In the Beginning</strong></p>
        <p>On May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its
          shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I
          was surprised by the price.<br>
          Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership Ltd.
          (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before
          the tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered
          $11.50, and he said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less.
          I bristled at Stanton’s behavior and didn’t tender.<br>
          That was a monumentally stupid decision.<br>
          Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it
          operated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was
          unable to change course.<br>
          That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own Board
          minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of
          business forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply
          and demand have been balanced.”<br>
          About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing – both
          with roots in the 19th Century – joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and
          10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements viewed
          as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the
          consolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.<br>
          Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase shares. And
          that pattern caught my attention.<br>
          I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more repurchases.
          The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and book value
          of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff
          remaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure
          was enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.<br>
          Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set
          out to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of
          our original purchases. There it was – my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere
          for other discarded butts.<br>
          Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire
          shares.

        <p><strong>Vice Chairman’s Thoughts – Past and Future</strong></p>
        <p>To the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:</p>
        <p>I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seems
          appropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do five
          things.<br>
          (1) Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commodity textile
          business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,<br>
          (2) Explain how the management system and policies came into being,<br>
          (3) Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,<br>
          (4) Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and<br>
          (5) Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful
          elsewhere.<br>
          The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”)
          were fixed early and are described below:<br>
          (1) Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful
          predictions.<br>
          (2) Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs would
          operate with very extreme autonomy.<br>
          (3) There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a
          Chairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.<br>
          (4) Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group would
          be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing substantial “float”
          (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.<br>
          (5) There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system,
          retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.<br>
          (6) Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself.<br>
          (i) He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’s casualty
          insurers.<br>
          (ii) He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and obtain from
          each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.<br>
          (iii) He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive
          advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.<br>
          (iv) He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’s CEO, and he
          would require almost no additional contact.<br>
          (v) He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he would
          wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours of answering
          questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.<br>
          (vi) He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders, and other
          incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.<br>
          (vii) His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly that
          which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and</p>

        <p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</p>
        <p>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES</p>
        <p>The Board of Directors has adopted the following guidelines to promote the effective governance of the Company. The Board will also review and amend these guidelines as it deems necessary or appropriate.</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Company’s shareholders, the Board is responsible for overseeing the management of the business and affairs of the Company. The Board acts as the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except on those matters reserved to or shared with the shareholders of the Company under the laws of Delaware.</p>
        <p>1. Director Qualifications<br>
          In choosing directors, the Company seeks individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, owner-oriented attitude, a genuine interest in the Company and a significant investment in Berkshire shares relative to their resources for at least three years. The Company is required to elect a majority of directors who are independent. All references to “independent directors” in these guidelines are to directors who are independent according to the criteria for independence established by Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. The Board does not have limits on the number of terms a director may serve. The Board does not have any retirement or tenure policies that would limit the ability of a director to be nominated for reelection. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee is responsible for nominating directors for election or reelection.</p>
        <p>2. Board Size and Committees<br>
          The Board presently has 14 members (three management directors, three non- management but not independent directors and eight independent directors). Under the By- Laws of the Company, the Board has the authority to change its size, and the Board will periodically review its size as appropriate. The Board has three committees:<br>
          (i) Audit; (ii) Governance, Compensation and Nominating; and (iii) Executive. The Audit and Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committees each consist solely of independent directors. The Board may, from time to time, establish and maintain additional or different committees, as it deems necessary or appropriate.</p>
        <p>3. Voting for Directors<br>
          Any nominee for director in an uncontested election (i.e., an election where the number of nominees is not greater than the number of directors to be elected) who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her election than votes “for” such election shall, promptly following certification of the shareholder vote, offer his or her resignation to the Board for consideration in accordance with the following</p>

        <p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</p>
        <p>CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS</p>
        <p>1.1 Scope<br>
          This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”) applies to all Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) directors, officers and employees, as well as to directors, officers and employees of each subsidiary of Berkshire. Such directors, officers and employees are referred to herein collectively as the “Covered Parties.” Berkshire and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as the “Company.”</p>
        <p>2.1 Purpose<br>
          The Company is proud of the values with which it conducts business. It has and will continue to uphold the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity in all types of transactions and interactions. To this end, this Code serves to:<br>
          - Emphasize the Company’s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law;<br>
          - Set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior;<br>
          - Provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and<br>
          - Help prevent and detect wrongdoing.<br>
          Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the Company’s course of business, this Code serves as a broad view of how Berkshire and each of its subsidiaries should direct the work, business relationships, decisions and actions taken on their behalf by their respective directors, officers and employees. When confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Parties should remember the Company’s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment. When in doubt, remember Warren Buffett’s rule of thumb: “…I want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper – to be read by their spouses, children and friends – with the reporting done by an informed and critical reporter.”</p>
        <p>3.1 Violation of Ethical Standards<br>
          3.1.1 Reporting Known or Suspected Violations.<br>
          Covered Parties should report known or suspected illegal or unethical behavior to supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel. These Covered Parties may also report questionable behavior in the same manner as they may report complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters by contacting (anonymously, if desired) a third-party organization called NAVEX Global (toll-free number 800-261-8651 or web site at <a href="http://brk-hotline.com">http://brk-hotline.com</a>). Separate anonymous reporting procedures are available for Company employees working outside the United States. No retaliatory action of any kind will be permitted against anyone making such a report in good faith.</p>

        <p>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</p>
        <p>To: The Directors, Executive Officers and Key Employees of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the Executive Officers and Key Employees of its Subsidiaries</p>
        <p>From: Warren E. Buffett</p>
        <p>Re: "Insider" Trading Policies and Procedures</p>
        <p>Several provisions in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder restrict transactions in publicly-traded securities by persons possessing "inside" information - material nonpublic information relevant to the value of such securities. In light of these provisions, it is imperative that all persons who possess material nonpublic information about publicly-traded securities: 1) refrain from purchasing or selling such securities; and 2) refrain from "tipping" (i.e. passing along) such information to others who may purchase or sell such securities.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that this restriction applies not only to material nonpublic information relevant to securities issued by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (which, for purposes of this policy, includes all of its subsidiaries) but also to material nonpublic information relevant to any other publicly-traded securities. This latter category would include securities of other public companies in which Berkshire has invested or is actively considering making an investment. For example, while Berkshire may properly purchase securities even though the news of such purchases might cause a price increase, employees, officers and directors of Berkshire who learn this news in advance of public disclosure could not purchase these securities until the news had been disclosed publicly. The restriction does not apply to (1) Berkshire investment managers with whom Berkshire has entered into a written trading arrangement permitting such manager to trade alongside Berkshire in the securities of other public companies, to the extent and on the terms provided in such arrangement, and (2) any trading in Berkshire securities pursuant to a valid Rule 10b5-1 plan entered into with the prior consent of Marc Hamburg (any trading permitted under such an arrangement or taking place under such a plan, “Permitted Trading”).</p>
        <p>The penalties for trading or "tipping" inside information can be severe. Among other things, a person who trades on material nonpublic information, or who provides such information to others, is potentially subject to a civil penalty of up to three times the profits earned or losses avoided, a criminal fine of up to $5,000,000, no matter how small the profit obtained, and a jail term of up to 20 years. In 2012 alone, the SEC and Department of Justice brought 86 insider trading cases alone.</p>
        <p>Securities laws also subject controlling persons to civil penalties for illegal insider trading by employees, including employees located outside the United States. Controlling persons include employers (e.g., Berkshire), and the term is being interpreted by the SEC to include directors, officers and supervisors. These persons may be subject to fines up to the greater of $1,000,000 or three times the profit of (or loss avoided by) the insider trader.</p>

        <p>PROHIBITED BUSINESS PRACTICES POLICY</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Preamble and Instructions to Berkshire Subsidiaries:</p>
        <p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) has prepared this compliance policy to provide its subsidiaries and their respective employees with written guidance related to anti-corruption/anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, export/import compliance matters, anti-money laundering and intermediary management. Each subsidiary is expected to adopt, implement and incorporate these requirements into its respective written policies and procedures or Code of Conduct. Each Berkshire subsidiary shall distribute the policy to its Senior Management and other individuals who manage the risk areas or are likely to be faced with the compliance risks discussed in this document (translated into the applicable languages of the regions in which the subsidiary operates). Each Berkshire subsidiary is directed to develop a culture of ethics and compliance at all levels of the company.</p>
        <p>This policy is not intended to supplant more restrictive, detailed or specific policies which may already be in place at a Berkshire subsidiary. Except to the extent modified to comply with foreign laws as discussed below in the instructions to Sections IV and V of this policy or as otherwise permitted by Section III of this policy, this policy sets forth the minimum standard with which all Berkshire subsidiaries must comply. Each subsidiary shall devote sufficient resources to effectively train personnel and any agent, consultant, representative, sales agent, reseller, distributor, joint venture partner, customs/import broker, freight forwarder, contractor or other third party (“Intermediary”) as they conduct business on behalf of or for the benefit of Berkshire or any of its subsidiaries on the requirements of its compliance program and this policy and ensure that personnel and intermediaries have access to the subsidiary’s anti-corruption and trade and sanctions compliance policies. Each subsidiary shall also ensure that policies are updated on a regular basis and that those charged with day-to-day operational responsibility for compliance programs have sufficient resources, autonomy and direct access to governing authorities and Senior Management of the subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Each subsidiary shall ensure a mechanism exists for the timely and thorough investigation of any concerns of misconduct by the subsidiary, its employees or intermediaries, including communication to Berkshire where appropriate, and that any violation is appropriately remediated after performing a root cause analysis—including appropriate employee discipline. Each subsidiary is required to implement policies and procedures, that, to the maximum extent provided for under applicable law, allow for the collection and review of emails, texts, online communication applications (including WhatsApp messages), instant message communications and electronically stored documents for auditing, compliance and compliance investigation purposes by the subsidiary, Berkshire, outside legal counsel or forensic accountants working at the direction of Berkshire or the subsidiary. Within those policies and procedures, each subsidiary, to the extent consistent with applicable law, shall obtain advance consent from employees to allow for the collection and review of the aforementioned data.</p>

If the Board has determined that a member of the Audit Committee is an audit committee financial expert, it may presume that such member has accounting or related financial management expertise.</p>

        <p><strong>Conflict Minerals Policy Statement</strong></p>
        <p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”) are committed to complying with the Conflict Minerals Rule (“the Rule”) issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We acknowledge, and share the concern that conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its adjoining countries (collectively, the “Covered Countries”) may be helping finance armed conflict in these regions. In accordance with the Rule, we are working with our direct suppliers to ensure the responsible sourcing of “conflict minerals” – the ores of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – through our global supply chains.</p>
        <p>Berkshire is a holding company owning subsidiaries that engage in a number of diverse business activities with varying levels of complexity in their supply chains. Subsidiaries are managed on a decentralized basis. Therefore, Berkshire provides guidance to subsidiaries on their conflict minerals compliance programs and subsidiaries implement their programs independently, in a manner that is best suited to their specific industry and circumstances, but within guidelines provided by Berkshire.</p>
        <p>Berkshire’s subsidiaries operate downstream of ore extraction and smelting activities and do not directly source conflict minerals globally. The global supply chain for conflict minerals is complex and includes multiple tiers of activity from mines, smelters and refiners. Therefore, we are relying on information provided by our suppliers to support our responsible sourcing efforts, and for compliance with the Rule.</p>
        <p>We expect our suppliers to respond to our conflict minerals inquiries in a timely manner and provide us with required information on the source and use of conflict minerals in the products supplied to us.</p>
        <p>As part of our conflict minerals efforts, we engage relevant suppliers in our global supply chain, conduct due diligence activities by leveraging the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Framework, and file a conflict minerals disclosure annually as required by the SEC.</p>
        <p>Berkshire is committed to ongoing improvement of our responsible sourcing efforts and the traceability of our global supply chains.</p>
        <p>For questions or concerns related to our conflict minerals initiatives, suppliers and other external stakeholders may contact us by mail at Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 3555 Farnam Street, Suite 1440, Omaha, NE 68131.</p>
